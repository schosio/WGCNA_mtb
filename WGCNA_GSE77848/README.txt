Title: Expression analysis of M.tb. H37Rv after treatment with DTT for 3 hours

Experiment type: Expression profiling by array

Summary: Effect of Thiol reductive stress (DTT 5mM) on M.tb Rv was studied

Overall design: DTT reduced at 5mM concentration was added to log phase culture of M.tb H37Rv. After 3 hours RNA was isolated and 
hybridization was done on Affym Affymetrix microarrays.
